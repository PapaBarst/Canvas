# Canvas
Canvas is a simple, open-source tool for drawing shapes and images in C#. The goal of this program is to provide an intuitive, easy to use drawing interface for people new to coding in C#, while still allowing higher level manipulation and functionality. 

# Learning
Canvas was designed with learning in mind, allowing students and new learners to visualize their code while slowly introducing them to new ideas. A general learning structure using Canvas could be similar to the following:
1. Learning basic C# syntax (for loops, if statements, switches) using methods like `Rectangle` and `Ellipse` to visualize the results
2. Learning about objects by using a `RectangleC` object and manipulating its properties to move it around the window
3. Learning about Lists and Arrays by manipulating the drawstack
4. Learning about interfaces by looking at the `Drawable` interface
5. Creating custom shapes by creating custom classes and implementing the `Drawable` interface
